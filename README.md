# Big Data Analytics for Tracking COVID-19 Spread and Mortality Trends Across Regions
## Abstract
Each geographic region has seen significant changes in daily life, economics, and global health because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant regional differences in the virus’s transmission and fatality have surfaced despite massive crisis management measures. It is essential to comprehend these distinctions to enhance future pandemic preparedness and public health responses. Using Big Data analytics approaches, this paper attempts to investigate the global prevalence and death trends of COVID-19 across all continents. 
A structured data pipeline that can clean, filter, and visualise time-series data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by continent is built using publicly accessible datasets. Data wrangling and analysis are carried out using Jupyter Notebook and Python programming, which makes it possible to identify peak infection periods, regional differences, and changing trends in the pandemic’s progression. By pointing out important continental patterns, pinpointing regions with high death rates, and providing comparative data, the study helps determine the scope and timing of COVID-19’s effects. These finding are presented in an understandable manner using data visualisation like line graphs and heat maps. 
Through a better knowledge of the global dynamics of COVID-19, our research helps the global health community make data-driven decisions and improves readiness for future pandemics. 

## Background of the study 
Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment. We tried to find some useful information by analysing the COVID-19 screening data, to provide help for clinical practice.
Starting in December 2019, cases of pneumonia with unknown causes began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Subsequently, the outbreak of this pneumonia quickly spread throughout the Hubei province, country, and world. This pneumonia was confirmed to result from a novel coronavirus infection according to whole-genome sequencing. On January 13, 2020, the World Health Organization tentatively named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On February 7, 2020, China officially named this novel coronavirus pneumonia as NCP. Later, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially renamed the NCP as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
COVID-19 is mainly characterized by pulmonary inflammation, which can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and nervous system. It can also cause fever, cough, and other symptoms. The clinical manifestations are like those of other viral infections, and thus differential diagnosis from other viral infections is necessary.
The clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly relies on laboratory virus nucleic acid detection but is affected by virus levels in patients and sample collection methods. False-negative results are frequently observed. Additionally, numerous studies have reported changes in the laboratory detection data of patients with COVID-19, and studies typically focus on one or several hematology indices, limiting the applicability of the research results. Therefore, we comprehensively analysed and compared the laboratory data of screened patients with COVID-19 to provide a basis for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of this disease compared to influenza.

One of the key challenges in managing the pandemic has been the dynamic and regionally varied nature of its spread and impact. Understanding when and where the virus surged, how mortality rates evolved, and how different regions responded provides critical insight into managing current and future pandemics. However, making sense of massive, multi-source datasets requires big data analytics.
This report aims to provide a comparative analysis of COVID-19 spread and mortality across all continents. By leveraging time-series data from reliable public sources, the study seeks to highlight trends, disparities, and commonalities in how the pandemic unfolded globally.
The contributions of this report include:
•	Data acquisition from global repositories (e.g., Johns Hopkins, WHO)
•	Data cleaning and preparation for time-series analysis
•	Visualization of COVID-19 cases and death trends by continent
•	Identification of peak periods and regional impact
